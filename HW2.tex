\problem{1}


\problem{2}
Derive a one-dimensional minimization algorithm based on quadratic fit that only requires objective function
values (but no derivatives). Specifically, derive an algorithm that computes $x_{k+1}$
based on $x_k,x_{k-1},x_{k-2}$, and $f(x_k),f(x_{k-1}),f(x_{k-2})$. 
Hint: To simplify notation, used
$\delta_{i,j} = x_{k-i} - x_{k-j}$ and $\sigma_{i,j} = (x_{k-i})^2 - (x_{k-j})^2$

Bonus: implement your algorithm as a MATLAB script and apply it to the numerical problems, above. 
Note that you will needthree points to initialize the algorithm.
